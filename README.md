#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
    Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems, involving the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software products.
    It's importance is in the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.
    
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
     1. Development of programming languages (e.g., Fortran, C) - Fortran, developed by IBM, was the first high-level programming language, designed for scientific and engineering calculations. C, developed at Bell Labs, introduced portability and efficiency, becoming a foundation for modern programming languages.
     2. Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s - The term "software engineering" was first introduced at the 1968 NATO Conference to address the "software crisis"—the growing complexity of software systems, cost overruns, and unreliable software, leading to formal methods, structured development processes, and best practices aimed at improving software quality, maintainability, and efficiency.
      3. Advent of structured programming in the 1970s - It emerged as a response to the chaotic and error-prone nature of early software development. This approach emphasized breaking programs into smaller, modular, and well-organized blocks using constructs like loops, conditionals, and functions. Languages like Pascal, C, and Ada encouraged structured programming, leading to more maintainable and reliable software Popularized by Edsger Dijkstra.
      
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  - Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
  - Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
  - Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
  - Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
  - Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
  - Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
    In terms of approach waterfall methodolgy is linear and sequential while agile methodology is iterative and incremental
    In terms of flexibiliy, waterfall methodology is rigid; difficult to make changes once a phase is completed while agile methodology it's highly flexible; allowing continous adjustments.
    In terms of risk management, waterfall methodology's risks are discovered late in the process while in agile methodology the risks are mitigated early through constant feedback.
    Example where Wterfall methodology is used - Well-Defined Requirements – Projects where requirements are unlikely to change, such as government contracts or regulatory compliance systems.
    Example where Agile methodology is used - Teams working in DevOps or cloud-based services, where frequent iterations improve quality.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
  - Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
  - Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
  - Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
   -  Integrated development environments are comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).
  - Version Control Systems (VCS) are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g., Git, Subversion).
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
    Challenges include:
      - Changing Requirements
      - Tight Deadlines
      - Technical Debt
    Startegies to ovvercome include:
     - effective communication,
     - agile methodologies,
     - prioritization of tasks
     - regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
  - Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
  - Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
  - System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
  - Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
  Importance to quality assurance - Quality control measures such as code reviews, automated testing, and continuous integration help identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
      

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
    Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. 
    Prompt engineering helps in making your questions clear and specific, so the AI understands exactly what you need.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. 
    Vague prompt - "Tell me about health in Kenya"
    Improved prompt - "Tell me about the evolution of the health sector in Kenya" 
Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
  It's clear specific and concise.
